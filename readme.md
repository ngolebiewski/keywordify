Have you ever job searched for 6 months+?
That's me looking for a software engineering gig.

Could it be the market?

Could it be I don't have enough keywords from the job description in my resume?

I decided to write a python script to check.
But even better, write a Flask app to do it too.

Learning Flask as I go. So here we go!
