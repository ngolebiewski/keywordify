# Keywordify
Have you ever job searched for 6 months+?
That's me looking for a software engineering gig.

Could it be the market?

Could it be I don't have enough keywords from the job description in my resume?
At least that is testable and fixable.

I decided to write a python script to check.
But even better, write a Flask app to do it too.

Learning Flask as I go. So here we go!

# HOW TO USE
1. Save a job description as a txt file
2. Save your resume as a txt file
3. Upload each to the site.
4. See the results and rewrite your resume away

## Todo
0. ~~Deploy to Render~~
1. Add style
2. View current keywords + option to add to list
3. Be pseudo LLM-y and build new keywords off of the job descriptions that are uploaded
4. Build login to save your resume (can Render do SQLite from just their web services plan?)
