ABOUT PROJECT HEALTHY MINDS

Project Healthy Minds is a mental health tech non-profit startup. We are pioneering a first-of-its-kind model: applying technology to address one of the biggest social issues of our time: the growing mental health crisis. We believe in a simple but profound idea: that it should be as easy to find mental health services as it is to book a flight or a restaurant reservation. That's why we're building the world’s first digital marketplace for finding mental health services that are right for you. 

To do that, we work with some of the most inspiring and influential leaders in America - business titans, tech entrepreneurs, clinicians and scientists, musicians, artists, athletes, media stars, policymakers, and more. Because we believe that the world's most complex challenges require interdisciplinary teams and solutions.

We are backed by a powerhouse of industry-leading Board of Directors and Advisory Council Members who are passionate, hands-on, and dive into the important work with us.
